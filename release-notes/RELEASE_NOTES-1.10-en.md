### Default document validity duration

This new parameter allow you to define, in days, the default validity duration for commercial proposal documents in the application. The validity date will be automatically pre-filled when you'll generate a commercial proposal.

### Force trade in estimation.

In the event of a trade in, you can now fill some new fields to estimate the selling cost of the trade in vehicle and the cost of the repairs.
Those two fields can be mandatory and block the completion of the trade in if you select "yes" to this now option.

# That's fixed
