# September 2021 - Version 1.10.0

# Calendar

You can now display multiple workspaces in a single calendar.

When multiple workspaces are displayed:

- The load is displayed as unkown as it can only take the workshop tasks in account.
- Tasks colors uses the multiple workspaces configuration.

# That's fixed
