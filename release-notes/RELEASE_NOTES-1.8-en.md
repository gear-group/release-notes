# July 2021 - Version 1.8.0

## Baskets

- You may now send a vehicle basket a to the workshop even if the vehicle doesn't have a VIN (for example because the vehicle is ordered).

## Client selection (tasks, basket, etc.)

- When selecting a client, its vehicles are now displayed.

- In some contexts, we need to select, among other things, both a client and one of its vehicle. Therefore, it's now possible to select the vehicle directly together with the client.
