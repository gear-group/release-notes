# August 2021 - Version 1.9.0

## Product category changes

We have split the "other_services_and_taxes" into "other_services" and "other_taxes" in order to provide more VAT automation in the future. However, this process cannot be fully automated and requires your attention.

We have renamed the _other_services_and_taxes_ category to _other_services_ in all catalogs, but we didn't renamed it elsewhere, especially in accountancy mapping rules.

      Please do check your accountancy rules (Accountancy > Accounts configuration)<br/>

    </li>
    <li>Please do check product categories in existing opened baskets</li>
    <li>
      Please do check that products now in the "other_services" category should not be in "other_taxes" (you may use the category filter as below)<br/>
